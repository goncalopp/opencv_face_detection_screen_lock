This script periodically monitors a webcam and locks your computer if a face is not detected (i.e.: you left your seat).

Note this does not perform face *recognition*, which is a entirely different task.

The "xscreensaver" program is used to do the locking, but that can easily be adapted.

Dependencies:
 - OpenCV and its python bindings (python-opencv in debian and derivatives)
